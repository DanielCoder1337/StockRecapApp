1. Portfolio which contains investors

To calculate profits
->
For example if 500kr is deposited and the value of the portfolio is now 1000. You take 1000 - the last deposit which is 500kr which is 
500 left. Then take 500 and calculate everyones profit on this cut with each ones percentage. In this example its 100% so the profit was 500kr,
but if the depositer only had 45% of the capital at the last deposit its 500 * 0.45 which then is the profit.
